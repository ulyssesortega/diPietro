      | diPietro Todd Salon first opened its doors on Post Street in San Francisco in 1988, spearheaded by the husband and wife team of Kim and Andrew Todd, along with partner, the late John diPietro. Kim directed her focus on the business side while Andrew remained on the artistic. This division of labor has proved to be successful, for in the 23 years since the launch of diPietro Todd Salon, the company has expanded throughout the Bay Area, opening a total of 5 locations thus far (Mill Valley, Palo Alto, Walnut Creek and 2 locations in SF). 
    p  
      | In 1998, Kim and Andrew Todd implemented a training program for entry-level stylists called ‘Development’, designed and created by their top educators and directors. The program offers concentrated education in cutting or color as well as customer service, consultation, and retail. Dawn Seelenbacher, Director of Haircutting for Development, and Rebecca O’Reilly, Director of Hair Color for Development, team up with our highly experienced instructors to ensure our apprentices become well-rounded, highly accomplished, and solidly committed stylists and colorists. The Development program is an integral part to the company because it gives our employees a deep-rooted understanding of our company values, skills, qualifications, and standard of excellence. As a result, the staff at diPietro Todd Salon has grown from 8 employees in 1988 to over 150 employees today.

      | With five locations already in the Bay Area, diPietro Todd has also launched the diPietro Todd Academy in 2004, dedicated to teaching innovative techniques and collections to stylists and colorists around the world. Led by Amita Moticka, Director of Haircutting, and Shelley Mohr, Director of Color, this educational entity conducts hands-on seminars held at diPietro Todd locations as well as other salons in the U.S. and worldwide. In an industry with few schools today, diPietro Todd has created a product that is completely unique, unrivaled, and greatly demanded. The diPietro Todd Academy explores the process of learning and the development of ideas. The Academy conducts seminars and demonstrations designed specifically to reach all aspects of cutting, color, and styling while giving students practical knowledge of the beauty industry. The Academy is built upon the understanding that creativity comes second to a strong foundation. We hope to inspire seasoned veterans of the hair industry while customizing coursework to reach different learning styles and ideas. It allows experienced stylists the opportunity to hone their skills in specifically designed workshops.
